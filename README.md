"# AndroidFirebaseChattutorial" 

This is following tutorial provided at:
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-an-android-chat-app-using-firebase--cms-27397

Note:  The tutorial at link found is a bit outdated in terms of setup.  I recommend reading my build.gradle (module) file for
setup guidance.  Also helps to follow firebase setup wizards (as shown in tutorial) for setup.  This will ensure that build.gradle
is generally configured properly.
